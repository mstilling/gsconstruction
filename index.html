                    First off, we want to start out by saying we are so pleased with our new home that words can’t really explain. The quality of the construction was only exceeded by the service Sean provided throughout the entire process.  From our initial walk through with us prior to even purchasing the land to the moment we moved in Sean was there to answer every question and concern. The service he provided is very uncommon in today’s world. We believe the highest compliment we can give is recommending him to our friends and colleagues which we have done on numerous occasions. <br><br>

                    We are very happy with how our house turned out thanks to G&S Construction LLC. Our architect gave us Sean’s name and number and just from talking to him I knew they were the builders for us. Even the neighbors on both sides of us commented on how meticulous  the workers were, they were always measuring everything, it reminded me of the old saying “measure twice, cut once”. We were kept up to date on the progress as the construction went along. We knew what work was scheduled for the next week. Knowing this was going to be our retirement house Sean came up with some changes that made sense as we age and did not cost extra. The entire crew was friendly, respectful, and they made sure they cleaned up everyday. <br><br>

                    We have known Sean Timmer for 7 years, a friend recommended him to us as we were building a new house. Sean looked at our project, listened to our thoughts, talked to us in a level we can understand, analyzed our thoughts, made some recommendations (all good) and we have worked with him ever since. Sean has been involved with us, our house, our detached garage, our grocery store, added on a new deli prep area and cooler, in the liquor store, and also in our East Troy location. Currently, G&S is taking out a restaurant in our Shopping Center and installing a new Snap Fitness. Sean is a “hands-on guy”, he holds his workers and his sub’s to the level he would expect from himself. In a few words, G&S Builders is a quality operation, on time, on budget, fair, and honest.<br><br>

                  <p class="color3">
                    When we set out to find a homebuilder a few years ago my wife and I realized we would be making the biggest financial investment decision of our lives. There were so many options, how were we ever going to choose? After meeting with multiple potential builders, we decided upon Sean and his team with G&S for two reasons. He was the only one willing to spend the time taking us to see past projects he had previously completed as well as to connect us with those he was currently working on projects for. Secondly, he was the only one other local builders commented on as “he does a really nice job”. From the others who had built with Sean we kept on hearing common themes such as “obsessive attention to detail”, “always available for communication” and “the most honest and trustworthy builder you will meet.” In addition, when your competition speaks highly of you, it says something.<br><br>

                    As we went through our build process time and time again it became clear that we made the right decision for a few reasons.<br><br>

                    The first was communication. Both of us work full time jobs so early mornings, early evenings, and weekends were easiest for us. Regardless of the time of day, Sean was available for questions or follow-up and always willing to meet at our home site to go over things and next steps. In addition, Sean was not afraid to let us know if something was not going to make sense or look right. With a completely custom home things sometimes look good on paper but different when they come to life. Rather than just build as designed, Sean was not afraid to bring these to our attention and give us the option to change before it got too far. This saved us on multiple occasions during our build.<br><br>

                    The second was Sean’s meticulous attention to detail in order to produce high quality. Sean literally pays attention to every corner and angle and makes sure that quality work is done. If something is not right, he redoes it without hesitation. Now that we are in our home we can “feel” this quality and it is real compared to so many of the homes produced by other builders in the area.<br><br>

                    The third was the ease and the flexibility of the process to build with G&S. Over the years Sean has developed a process to keep the project on task. He gives you sequential decision points with advance notice, so you can make these decisions on your own time rather than rushing to choose everything at once. In addition, we had the ability to explore our own options and get our own bids for things if we wanted to put in the extra time and the work. This is rare flexibility in today’s world of home builders and something we greatly appreciated.<br><br>

                    Finally, the relationship we developed with Sean throughout the process was second to none. The relationship is not client and builder but rather person to person. In addition, every time we stopped by the project his team with G&S was willing to stop and take the time and visit with us. In a world filled with people looking to “sell others on something” Sean truly is the honest and trustworthy exception amongst builders.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Having completed our project in May 2018 we now consider Sean a friend and will forever be thankful that we chose to build with G&S Builders.</span>
